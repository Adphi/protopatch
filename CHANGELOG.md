# Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes
- Renamed the `stringer_name` option to `stringer` to match the Go [`fmt.Stringer`](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Stringer) interface. For backwards compatibility, `stringer_name` will be supported for at least 6 months.

### Added
- Struct tags, including defaults generated by `protoc-gen-go` can be replaced. The struct tag code was overhauled using the terrific [`structtag`](https://github.com/fatih/structtag) package by [@fatih](https://github.com/fatih). Thanks to [@liov](https://github.com/liov) for the initial prototype in [#15](https://github.com/alta/protopatch/pull/15).
- Updated docs, examples, and tests to use concise option syntax instead of `{}` delimited options.

### Fixed
- [#21](https://github.com/alta/protopatch/issues/21) — It is now possible to patch output of other plugins like [`protoc-gen-validate`](https://github.com/envoyproxy/protoc-gen-validate).

### Known Issues

## [v0.1.0] — 2020-12-23

### Known Issues
- [#21](https://github.com/alta/protopatch/issues/21) — Running `protoc` plugins other than `go` breaks on missing symbols.
- [#15](https://github.com/alta/protopatch/pull/15) — It’s not currently possible to mix or replace existing generated struct tags.
